# A thought on monasticism and marriage.

I have neither experienced monasticism nor marriage but I would like to share a thought on it regardless.

> Life is the most exquisite of paintings, but to experience life without the light of God is to experience a monotone shade. The colours cheap and muted; no Prussian blue nor Tyrian Purple. When in periods of great blessing or through a life led in devotion to God we can so clearly see the great window of God's love open to us - something that can sometimes feel closed and opaque, irregardless of its true state. The Lord stands forever at our side but we cannot always feel his presence, but, through partnership with and love for someone else, we may feel a portion of His love through them, and once again gaze upon His handcrafted tapestry.

+ May God bless you. +
